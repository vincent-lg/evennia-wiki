evennia-wiki
============

A simple wiki for `Evennia`_, simple to install within an Evennia game.

Installation
------------

For the time being, you should install from source. Assuming you are in
this directory (where the README.rst file is):

::

    pip install -e .

Then, in your Evennia folder, edit ``server/conf/settings.py`` to add
the installed app:

.. code:: python

    INSTALLED_APPS += (
            # ...
            "evennia_wiki",
    )

Finally, in ``web/urls.py``, you should add the custom URL:

.. code:: python

    custom_patterns = [
        # ...
        url(r'^wiki/', include('evennia_wiki.urls',
                namespace='wiki', app_name='wiki')),
    ]

Don’t forget to run ``evennia migrate`` after that.
